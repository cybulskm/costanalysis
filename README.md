This is a simple cost analysis webapp for expensive goods/services. I made this so I could quickly compare expenses for different cars I would like to purchase, making my purchasing options smarter. 

After inputting your expenses and hourly wage, the app returns the amount of hours of work needed to cover monthly expenses as well as the remaining expenses. This could be used to analyze the cost for getting a car or house; anything with a mixed expense of a principle cost and monthly interest. 

Reports are only stored in memory while the webapp is running. Websites of similar nature only store user data for limited periods of time, and I figure this should be the same. Exports of reports as PDF's are available.


Side note:
I know this Git setup isn't proper, I'm still getting used to making public repos.
